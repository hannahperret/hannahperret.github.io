        Hello my name is Hannah Noelle Perret. I am 22 years old and live in the great state of Colorado. I am a current senior in college and I graduate in Fall of 2020, pursuing a degree in Mass Communications with an Emphasis in Electronic Media. I have many different interests and love to evolve my interests and talents. I have loved animals and people all my life. I have a love for painting and exploring new ways to artistically invest into new topics and scenarios. I am always ready to work hard for something I am passionate about and also when I am at work. I have an empathetic personality and find it easy for me to work with others.

	<h2>Life Journey</h2>
	<p>
        I was born in Denver, CO and lived there for almost five years. I then moved to Colorado Springs, CO and lived there for 4 years. After living in Colorado for a little over nine years my family moved to Houston, Texas and lived there for around three and a half years, and then we moved to a small town of Edmond, Oklahoma and lived there for four years. Finally we moved back to the beautiful state of Colorado after about eight years of living away from what I call home. I know what you are thinking, no I did not grow up in military family.

	<p>
        In my life time I have had many different interactions with many different people which has helped me with bettering my forms and success of communication. I have attended eight different schools during my K-12 education. This has allowed me to meet different people from all different walks of life and has allowed me to be able to better relate with others around me. I was also able to learn how to read others better and allowed me to positively reach out and hold relationships between others.
	</p>
	<p>
        I have been lucky to live in all kinds of different places and have been able to meet all kinds of different people. I have been able to work all kinds of different jobs and have gained a lot of different job skills and experiences. 
	</p>
	<p>
        I have always been a super open and supportive person to those around me and have learned that in this world there are more important things than success. I believe that those are, love, fulfillment, and compassion to others are the most important things.
